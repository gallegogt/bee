# Bee - IOTA for the IoT

## Motivation

Providing data integrity and support for machine-to-machine micropayments is IOTA's vision in order to become the backbone protocol for Internet-of-Things (IoT). While the IoT will keep emerging and transforming itself over the next few years, IOTA has already brought its protocol to reality.

The current IOTA mainnet is globally distributed network of nodes, each running a node software: the [IOTA Reference Implementation (IRI)](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri). This node software has been developed for deployment in today's global cloud-based Internet. However, the current Internet has completely different properties and requirements than the future IoT. To deliver on it's promise, IOTA must provide a solution that tackles the various difficulties of this future environment.
